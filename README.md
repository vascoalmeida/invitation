# Invitation

Web application used to invite people to an event, being the main focus of this project not the front end aspect but the back end, combining three different programming languages to build a solid app:
-JavaScript to communicate with the server;
-PHP to handle requests
-Python scripts to serve as a bridge when importing data from diferent databases (through .csv files) and to send invitation emails to invited people
